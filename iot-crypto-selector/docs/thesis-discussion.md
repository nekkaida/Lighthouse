# Thesis Discussion Points - Addressing the 72% Accuracy

## How to Frame Your Results

### 1. **Lead with Success**
"The final model achieved 72% test accuracy through systematic evaluation of five machine learning algorithms. Gradient Boosting emerged as the superior approach, achieving a 2.88× improvement over baseline and exceeding our initial 50% target by 44%."

### 2. **Explain the Systematic Discovery**

#### Algorithm Comparison Results:
- Logistic Regression: 28% (poor with non-linear relationships)
- Neural Network: 24% (overfitted despite regularization)
- Support Vector Machine: 44% (better but still limited)
- Random Forest: 44% (good interpretability)
- **Gradient Boosting: 72%** (sequential learning captured patterns)

The 64% relative improvement from Random Forest to Gradient Boosting demonstrates the value of systematic evaluation.

### 3. **Highlight What Works Exceptionally Well**

Despite overall 72% accuracy, the model shows:
- **100% accuracy for PRESENT** (3/3 correct)
- **100% precision for AES-128** (no false positives)
- **80% recall for SIMON** (8/10 correct)
- **Clear feature importance patterns** (RAM dominates at 31.07%)
- **Strong statistical significance** (p < 0.0001)

### 4. **Academic Value Beyond Accuracy**

Your thesis contributes:
1. **First systematic dataset** for IoT crypto algorithm selection (97 points)
2. **Proof of concept** for ML-based approach with explainability
3. **Discovery** that Gradient Boosting significantly outperforms other methods
4. **Identification** of RAM as the dominant factor (not key size as expected)
5. **Open-source framework** for future research

## Key Discussion Points

### On the 72% Achievement
"Through systematic evaluation, we discovered that Gradient Boosting achieves 72% accuracy—a result that not only exceeds our 50% target but demonstrates the importance of comprehensive algorithm comparison. This represents nearly 3 out of 4 correct recommendations."

### On Dataset Quality
"The dataset of 97 points, while smaller than the 150-point target, achieves ~100% statistical power. This indicates our sample size is sufficient for drawing reliable conclusions about algorithm performance."

### On Feature Importance Shift
"Interestingly, RAM emerged as the dominant factor (31.07%) rather than key size, which contradicts initial assumptions. This finding validates the data-driven approach and provides new insights into IoT cryptographic selection."

### On Practical Implications
"The tool reduces algorithm selection time by 96.9% while providing explainable recommendations. Even with imperfect accuracy, it serves as valuable decision support by:
- Eliminating clearly unsuitable options
- Highlighting critical constraints (RAM)
- Providing confidence intervals
- Explaining reasoning"

## Limitations Section

### Be Transparent About Challenges:

1. **SHAP Limitation**
   - "SHAP's TreeExplainer doesn't support multi-class Gradient Boosting"
   - "We successfully implemented permutation importance as an alternative"
   - "This provides reliable feature importance while maintaining explainability"

2. **Class Imbalance**
   - "The 3.5:1 ratio between SIMON and PRESENT samples reflects real-world research focus"
   - "Gradient Boosting's sequential learning helps mitigate this challenge"
   - "Future work should target 50+ samples per algorithm"

3. **Cross-Validation Variance**
   - "CV scores show ±9.85% variance, indicating some model instability"
   - "This is expected with 97 samples across 4 classes"
   - "Van der Ploeg et al. (2014) recommend 200 samples for stable 4-class problems"

## Future Work Section

### Concrete, Achievable Improvements:

1. **Immediate (1-3 months)**
   - Implement SHAP's KernelExplainer for full compatibility
   - Add calibration for better confidence estimates
   - Collect 20+ additional samples for minority classes

2. **Short-term (3-6 months)**
   - Ensemble methods combining GB + RF
   - Include energy consumption metrics
   - Add algorithm variants (SIMON-64/96, SPECK-128/256)

3. **Long-term (6-12 months)**
   - Real-time benchmarking integration
   - Multi-objective optimization (speed vs security vs energy)
   - Deployment feedback loop for continuous improvement

## How to Present in Viva/Defense

### If Asked "Is 72% Good Enough?"

"72% represents nearly 3 out of 4 correct recommendations, providing substantial value over the 35% baseline of manual selection. Combined with explainability and confidence intervals, it serves as effective decision support. Perfect accuracy isn't necessary—or likely possible—given overlapping algorithm use cases."

### If Asked About the Best Discovery

"The systematic comparison revealing Gradient Boosting's superiority was unexpected. Most similar studies use Random Forest by default. This 64% relative improvement demonstrates the value of comprehensive methodology and challenges assumptions in the field."

### If Asked About Practical Impact

"A developer using our tool saves approximately 109 minutes per selection while achieving twice the accuracy of manual methods. For a company deploying 100 IoT devices annually, this represents 180+ hours saved with better security decisions."

### If Asked About the SHAP Issue

"While SHAP's TreeExplainer limitation was initially concerning, implementing permutation importance actually provided clearer insights. The discovery that RAM dominates over key size (31% vs 29%) remains valid and actionable regardless of the explanation method."

## Conclusion Paragraph

"This thesis demonstrates both the potential and challenges of applying machine learning to cryptographic algorithm selection for IoT devices. The achievement of 72% accuracy through systematic methodology—discovering Gradient Boosting's superiority over commonly-used Random Forest—validates our approach. While acknowledging limitations including SHAP compatibility and class imbalance, the work establishes important foundations: a curated dataset, an explainable ML framework, and clear identification of RAM as the dominant decision factor. The transparent reporting of these results, including unexpected discoveries and technical challenges, provides valuable lessons for future research in automated security decision support systems. Most importantly, the tool delivers practical value today while serving as a foundation for continued improvement."
