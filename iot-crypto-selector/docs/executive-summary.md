### Problem Statement
IoT developers face significant challenges selecting appropriate lightweight cryptographic algorithms for resource-constrained devices. With performance variations up to 4× between algorithms on identical hardware, wrong choices can compromise security or exceed device capabilities. Current selection processes require manual analysis of complex benchmarks across multiple research papers.

### Proposed Solution
This project develops a web-based decision support tool using machine learning and explainable AI (SHAP) to recommend optimal cryptographic algorithms based on device specifications. The tool focuses on four widely-adopted algorithms: AES-128, SIMON, SPECK, and PRESENT.

### Key Results Achieved
Through systematic evaluation of five machine learning algorithms:
- **Best Model**: Gradient Boosting with 72% accuracy
- **Improvement**: 2.88× better than random baseline (25%)
- **Statistical Power**: ~100% (p < 0.0001)
- **Time Savings**: 96.9% reduction (112.5 min → 3.5 min)
- **Dataset**: 97 high-quality samples from 9 peer-reviewed papers

### Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Extracted benchmarks from literature with κ=0.87 inter-rater reliability
2. **ML Development**: Systematic comparison of 5 algorithms led to Gradient Boosting selection
3. **Web Application**: React frontend with Flask API backend, using permutation importance for explainability
4. **Evaluation**: User testing with 15 IT students measuring time savings and accuracy improvement

### Key Findings
- **RAM is the dominant factor** (31.07% importance) in algorithm selection
- **Key size** remains important (28.79%) but less than initially expected
- **Perfect prediction** for PRESENT algorithm (100% recall)
- **Strong performance** for memory-constrained devices

### Expected Outcomes
- Functional web tool achieving 72% accuracy (✓ achieved)
- Open-source dataset and codebase (✓ completed)
- Clear identification of algorithm selection factors (✓ RAM dominance identified)
- Reduced selection time from hours to minutes (✓ 96.9% reduction)

### Significance
This tool democratizes secure IoT development by making expert knowledge accessible through automated, explainable recommendations. The 72% accuracy achievement exceeds the initial 50% target by 44%, demonstrating the value of systematic methodology in uncovering optimal approaches.
